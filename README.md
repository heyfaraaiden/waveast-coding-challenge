# waveast-coding-challenge  
Honing my HTML, (S)CSS + BEM Method, and JavaScript skills through some challenges by [Waveast](https://azhariemuhammad.notion.site/azhariemuhammad/Waveast-coding-challenge-58227634ffeb4ef9b966fb0cf0e25a04).  
  
**Note:** *mine may not look 100% the same as the design as I made slight differences in layout and elements to suit my taste. However, it seems 98% the same, lol [need to be more creative]* 😸  
**I'll keep updating this repooo** 👩🏼‍💻
